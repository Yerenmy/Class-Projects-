**Projects Repository**

This repository contains various projects that I have done in my learning journey studying computer science. This are all small projects in JAVA covering a range of different topics under Object Oriented Programming with JAVA

**Project 1.1**

**ESP Game:** A Java program where the user plays 11 rounds guessing a color that the computer randomly selects each time. 
**Concepts tested:** 
-loops, 
-random number generation, 
-conditional statements, 
-string comparison,
-user input/output handling.

**Project 1.2**

**Patient Management System:** A program that manages patient information and medical procedures using three classes: Patient, Procedure, and PatientDriverApp. **Concepts tested:** 
-object-oriented programming (classes, constructors, getters/setters), 
-data encapsulation, 
-information management.

**Project 1.3**

**CryptoManager Program:** A Java application implementing Caesar and Bellaso ciphers for encryption and decryption, along with test cases to validate the functionality. 
**Concepts tested:** 
-string manipulation, 
-Caesar and Bellaso cipher algorithms, 
-unit testing, 
-input validation.

**Project 1.4**

**Property Management System:** A Java project that models a property management company, using classes for managing properties, plots, and rental information, along with tests for validation. 
**Concepts tested:** 
-object-oriented programming (constructors, inheritance, method overloading), 
-encapsulation,
-testing with various scenarios.

**Project 1.5**


**Holiday Bonus Calculator:** A project that calculates holiday bonuses for stores based on their sales data, using a two-dimensional array and various utility methods.  
**Concepts tested:** 
-multi-dimensional arrays, 
-algorithm development,
-handling irregular data structures, 
-unit testing.

**Project 1.6**

**Beverage Shop Management System:** A Java project managing various beverage orders, including alcohol, coffee, and smoothies, along with customer details and pricing calculations.  
**Concepts tested:**
-inheritance, 
-polymorphism, 
-constructors,
